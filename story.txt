  Once upon a time there was a giraffe named Big Poppa. Big Poppa
lived in a community of many other animals, including chickens,
sea cucumbers, chipmunks, and penguins. No one understood how
how they all lived together despite their very different habitat
requirements, but that is not important. One day, a visitor arrived!

The visitor was a red panda! The other animals were very confused because
they had never seen anything so fluffy before. They adored his fur and would
cuddle it to keep warm at night. The red panda was very happy because he 
finally had other animals to talk to. He and Big Poppa formed a very close 
relationship.
